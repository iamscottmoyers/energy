## Energy Provider Visualisation

For easy comparison of many energy provider rates with controls
for Gas / Electricity usage estimate and the duration you're
planning on keeping the tariff for.

Note that the rates are hardcoded in a CSV file so they're
probably not up to date, may contain mistakes and are only
valid for my location.

I've represented annual discounts like OVO's 60 pound discount
for only having online and app customer support by including
the discount in the daily standing charge.
